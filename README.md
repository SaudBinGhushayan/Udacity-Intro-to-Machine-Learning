# Udacity-Intro-to-Machine-Learning
In this repository I'm going to list all my project that are required to finish the Nano-degree program
----------------------------------

Project 1 :Supervised Machine Learning 
---------------------------------
In this project I'm going to apply the Supervised Machine Learning techniques to help `Charityml` (a fictitious charity organization) to identify individuals that are likely to donate to their cause 

Project 2 :Deep Learning 
--------------------------------
In this project I created a Classifier from the scratch and applied it on the `CIFAR-10` dataset (images dataset) , I was able to classify the images in the dataset and my classifier got accuracy around 74% 

Project 3 :Unsupervised Machine Learning
-----------------------------------
